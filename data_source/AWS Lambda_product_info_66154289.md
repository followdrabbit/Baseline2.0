# Security in AWS Lambda

Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority. As an AWS customer, you benefit
from a data center and network architecture that is built to meet the
requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations.

Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you. The [shared
responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-
model/) describes this as security _of_ the cloud and security _in_ the cloud:

  * **Security of the cloud** â AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS services in the AWS Cloud. AWS also provides you with services that you can use securely. Third-party auditors regularly test and verify the effectiveness of our security as part of the [AWS compliance programs](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/). To learn about the compliance programs that apply to AWS Lambda, see [AWS services in Scope by Compliance Program](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/).

  * **Security in the cloud** â Your responsibility is determined by the AWS service that you use. You are also responsible for other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your companyâs requirements, and applicable laws and regulations. 

This documentation helps you understand how to apply the shared responsibility
model when using Lambda. The following topics show you how to configure Lambda
to meet your security and compliance objectives. You also learn how to use
other AWS services that help you to monitor and secure your Lambda resources.

For more information about applying security principles to Lambda
applications, see

lambda-operator-guide/security-ops) in Serverless Land.
